# Head first Object Oriented Analysis and Design Book
   This book is talking about a good software, how it's Analysis and Design looks like with examples.

# Table of Contents
* [Chapter One](#chapter-one)
* [Chapter Two](#chapter-two)

## Chapter One

  1. Write software that do what the client need it do.
  2. Apply some OOP princibles to be well designed and easy to maintain.
  3. Make it reusable and maintainable.
  
  ### Bullet Points

  * It takes very little for something to go wrong with an application that is fragile.

  * You can use OO principles like encapsulation and delegation to build applications that are flexible.

  * Encapsulation is breaking your application into logical parts that have a clear boundary that allows an object to hide its data and methods from other objects.

  * Delegation is giving another object the responsibility of handling a particular task.

  * Always begin a project by figuring out what the customer wants.

  * Once you’ve got the basic functionality of an app in place, work on refining the design so it’s flexible.

  * With a functional and flexible design, you can employ design patterns to improve your design further, and make your app easier to reuse.

  * Find the parts of your application that change often, and try and separate them from the parts of your application that don’t change.

  * Building an application that works well but is poorly designed satisfies the customer but will leave you with pain, suffering, and lots of late nights fixing problems.

  * Object oriented analysis and design (OOA&D) provides a way to produce well-designed applications that satisfy both the customer and the programmer.


## Chapter Two
   1. Gathering information from customers and stackHolders
   2. Make Use case for your Application from client's requierments.
   3. Make sure that software work proberly as the client want it do.

  ### Bullet Points
   * Requirements are things your system must do to work correctly.

   * Your initial requirements usually come from your customer.

   * To make sure you have a good set of requirements, you should develop use cases for your system.

   * Use cases detail exactly what your system should do.

   * A use case has a single goal, but can have multiple paths to reach that goal.

   * A good use case has a starting and stopping condition, an external initiator, and clear value to the user.

   * A use case is simply a story about how your system works.

   * You will have at least one use case for each goal that your system must accomplish.

   * After your use cases are complete, you can refine and add to your requirements.

   * A requirements list that makes all your use cases possible is a good set of requirements.

   * Your system must work in the real world, not just when everything goes as you expect it to.

   * When things go wrong, your system must have alternate paths to reach the system’s goals.
